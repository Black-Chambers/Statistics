**Benford's law**, also known as the **Newcomb–Benford law**, the **law of anomalous numbers**, or the **first-digit law**, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data"), the [leading digit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_digit "Leading digit") is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. Uniformly distributed digits would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.<br>

The distribution of the *n*-th digit, as *n* increases, rapidly approaches a uniform distribution with 10% for each of the ten digits, as shown below. Four digits is often enough to assume a uniform distribution of 10% as "0" appears 10.0176% of the time in the fourth digit, while "9" appears 9.9824% of the time.

| Digit | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st |  — | 30.1% | 17.6% | 12.5% | 9.7% | 7.9% | 6.7% | 5.8% | 5.1% | 4.6% |
| 2nd | 12.0% | 11.4% | 10.9% | 10.4% | 10.0% | 9.7% | 9.3% | 9.0% | 8.8% | 8.5% |
| 3rd | 10.2% | 10.1% | 10.1% | 10.1% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 9.9% | 9.9% | 9.9% | 9.8% |
