**Benford's law**, also known as the **Newcombâ€“Benford law**, the **law of anomalous numbers**, or the **first-digit law**, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data"), the [leading digit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_digit "Leading digit") is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. Uniformly distributed digits would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.
